Ron dropped off a couple of pages of hand drawn sketchs to make into a board.



CHANGE REQUESTS
1. change 4-pin header to 6-pin header

    Already thought I’d something. Please make it a 6pin header for the 
    switching so we can reference ground and have a spare too. Thanks

    6 pins instead of 4?  got it
2. correct board size appears to be 82x56mm
3. make sure to label Fx in/out on back of board!
4. DRC "solder mask aperture bridges items with different nets"
   SOT89 for 7805 has no solder bridge between pads for SMT part.
   I turned this error into a warning.  Don't know what I can do 
   to actually fix this.
